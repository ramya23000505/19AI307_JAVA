## AIM:
To develop a Java program to check 101 is positive or negative number.

## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program.
2.	Import the "Scanner" class from the "java.util" package.
3.	Define the main class named "Demo"
4.	Create a Scanner object sc to read input from the user.
5.	Read an integer input from the user and store it in variable "num"
6.	Check if num is less than 0: a) If true, print num + " is Negative".
b) Else, print num + " is Positive".
7. End the proram.

    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int num=sc.nextInt();
        if (num<0)
        {
            System.out.println(num+ " is Negative");
        }
        else
        {
        System.out.println(num+ " is Positive");
        }
